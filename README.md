# Singularity Containers

This repo contains all my container recipes which are built and hosted on singulariy-hub.org under `deanpettinga/`

## Motivation

singularity containers are best utilized when setting up a virtual environment e.g. though conda isn't sufficient.
When the underlying OS needs to be specified, this is where a singularity container comes in handy.
